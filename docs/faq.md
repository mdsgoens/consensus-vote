## 1. Isn't Consensus Voting just Bucklin Voting[1]?

In Bucklin voting, *all* second-choice votes are added to the tally if the first-choices are insufficient to elect a majority winner. Consensus voting differs in three ways:

1. It only adds votes to the tally when necessary to prevent the election of someone the voter likes less.
2. It always considers a voter's full preferences, making it resistent to "burying".
3. It allows voters to rank multiple first-choice preferences, choosing the "best" majority winner when multiple candidates have majority support.
